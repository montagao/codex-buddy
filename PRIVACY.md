# Codex Buddy Privacy Policy

_Effective October 14, 2025_

Codex Buddy is a Chrome extension that runs entirely in your browser. It does not collect, transmit, or sell any personal information.

## What the extension does

- Reads the visible content on `https://chatgpt.com/codex/tasks/*` pages after you click the extension action so it can build a markdown summary locally.
- Optionally opens `https://chat.openai.com/` with your preferred gpt-5 model and inserts the locally generated summary into the chat composer.
- Stores template preferences in `chrome.storage.sync` and caches the most recent summary in `chrome.storage.local` for your convenience.

## What the extension does **not** do

- It does **not** send page content, personal data, or usage analytics to any server.
- It does **not** integrate with third-party services or share data with third parties.
- It does **not** read or modify data on sites outside the two host permissions listed above.

## Data retention and control

All data stays on your device. You can clear the cached summary at any time by reloading the Codex page or removing the extension. Templates can be reset by visiting the options page and restoring defaults.
